# UniversityAppointmentManager
A University appointment management system using inheritance and OOP.

This solution used two main classes within its design structure: the ‘Person’ and ‘Appointment’ classes. Within both base classes were three inherited derived classes. The person class is derived into the ‘Student’, ‘Lecturer’ and ‘Admin’ classes. The appointment class is derived into the ‘Personal’, ‘Attendance’ and ‘Academic’ classes. 

Within the ‘Person’ class, the base contains the variables for an object’s first name, last name and email. These properties are required to create an object of all three inherited classes, so by defining these within the base, code does not have to be repeated.
